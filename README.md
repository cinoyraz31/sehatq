# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

1. In this system has 2 rules, consisting of:
- Admin
- user
- Can have more than 1 hospital and doctors can be more than 1 hospital

2. Admin can manage hospital data, doctors and doctor schedule which will finally appear on the user's screen.

3. For users who have 3 ways to login, you can register in the system and log in by Facebook social media

4 For the database does not join the migration (must create a manual first), but for those tables there are already files in migration.

5 for those who do not want database migration, I provide the database.sql file
